# drone-business
 A picture book story of how I found a niche in the world of radio controlled aircraft
 and ended up creating my own online gig at 13 years old custom building and selling drones.

# The Beginning: Science Fair 2011

I convinced my parents I needed an RC jet for a science fair project on UAVs as a display item during 
the presentation of this project at my middle school's science fair.  And so it happened, that I had a 
SkyFun jet from HobbyKing and a cheapo 72mhz radio control.  I promptly tried to fly it and crashed, even 
before the science fair itself.  I repaired it and still displayed it on the table with my giant poster board 
above.  Later on in life, I used this poster board to create a shipping box large enough for a RMRC Penguin 
aircraft frame after I was done flying it and had moved on to other projects.

# Research: 2012
I obviously had no money at 13 years old to buy any drone technology, but I basically researched as much as I could. 
This was during the time of YouTubers like Team Blacksheep (Raphael Pirker), muni86, and Crashz9, who were all pioneers of 
the world of FPV (First Person View) radio control piloting.  Raphael was of course, popular for his flight over New 
York City, which blew up the RC internet for some time about the dangers associated with FPV flying.

FPV in 2012 was hacking, soldering, and custom wiring looms everywhere.  There was no DJI Phantom to fly, and 
very little (read: zero) ready-to-fly FPV aircraft.  As I read RCGroups and FPVLab on a daily basis, I started to 
realize that there was a significant market for this sort of electronics setup service in the FPV hobby.  If you knew 
what parts to buy and how to wire the stuff, it was a breeze.  But with many folks still getting used to touch screen 
phones, this was a significant challenge.

A thus, the idea was born: I can learn how to set these wireless video link systems up for RC aircraft and sell them!
